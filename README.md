Python-Scraping-Real-Estate-Data
Python Real-World Application: Scraping real estate property data from the Internet using BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries.
I have used the Propertypro website for web scraping. PropertyPro is a real-estate property website that displays the information related to different properties. I have used a cached version of the website because its design has changed while writing the code. Also, I have extracted the data of all the properties in Rock Springs, Wyoming only. Other properties can also be extracted by tinkering with the url.
